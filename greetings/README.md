## ✨ Invoking the Ritual: Calling the `Hello` Spell

You have forged your **`greetings`** module—a rune inscribed with the magic of salutation.

In this chapter, you shall craft an **executable incantation**, a command-line spell that summons the power of the `Hello` function from your newly created module. This is not merely code—this is a conjuration, a binding between realms. With this invocation, your application shall become the vessel through which the greeting spell is unleashed.

Let your `main` package become the summoner, and your `greetings` module the source of arcane truth.
